Hey, I'm a 31 years old cyber security enthusiast and privacy advocated born and raised in Brazil, currently based in Berlin. I have always been somewhat around the infosec community but often felt like this was more like a complementary interest than anything else. Eventually after a few miserable years realising my job was getting repetitive and overall, quite boring, I finally decided to make a move towards cyber security. And boy, was I right.

These days you can find me playing CTFs, tinkering with new tech, messing on bug bounty programs, writing about the vulnerabilies I eventually find and overall, trying to give back to the community I had learnt so much from. When AFK, I like spending my time skateboarding around town, cycling, crafting music or just hanging with my girlfriend / friends over a few beers while not really talking about technology.
