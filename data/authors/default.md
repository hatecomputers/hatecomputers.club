Hey, I'm a 31 years old cyber security enthusiast and privacy advocated born and raised in Brazil, currently based in __Berlin__. I have always been somewhat around the infosec community but often felt like this was more like a complementary interest than anything else. Eventually after a few miserable years realising my job as a developer was getting repetitive and overall, quite boring, I finally decided to make a move towards cyber security. And boy, was I right. My job title currently says __Application Security Engineer__ if you are interested. 

These days you can find me playing CTFs, tinkering with new tech, messing on bug bounty programs, writing about the vulnerabilities I eventually find and overall, trying to give back to the community I had learnt so much from. When AFK, I like spending my time skateboarding around town, cycling, [crafting music](https://soundcloud.com/hatecomputers) or just hanging with my girlfriend / friends over a few beers while temporarily forgetting I work with technology.
